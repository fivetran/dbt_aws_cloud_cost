Otherwise, there will be one version of the file that is repeatedly overwritten/appended to by Amazon.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs report %}
The bucket/report combo this belongs to. Parsed out of `_file`.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs _fivetran_synced %}
The time at which fivetran last synced this record.

{% docs _modified %} Timestamp of when the file was read from AWS. {% enddocs %}

{% docs max_modified_for_billing_period %} For each billing period, the most recent `_modified` date. Used to find the latest version of the report file. {% enddocs %}

{% docs bill_bill_type %}
The type of bill that this report covers. There are three bill types:

- Anniversary: Line items for services that you used during the month.
- Purchase: Line items for upfront service fees.
- Refund: Line items for refunds. These will have negative cost amounts.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs cost_category %}
A map column containing key-value pairs of the cost categories and their values for a given line item. These keys and values are populated based on the categorization rules you create in the cost categories feature.

A cost category key only appears in the map column if it has a value that applies to the specific line item.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs discount %}
(Disabled by `INCLUDE MANUAL DISCOUNT COMPATIBILITY` CUR configuration)

A "struct" column containing key-value pairs of any specific discounts that apply to this line item. The keys correspond to a discount type and the values correspond to either the discount value or other information. The values in this column are either data type "numeric" or "string" depending on the specific key.

This column is not available when "Manual discount compatibility" is enabled. When it's enabled, discounts are populated as separate line items and not in this column.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs identity_line_item_id %}
This field is generated for each line item and is unique in a given partition. This does not guarantee that the field will be unique across an entire delivery (that is, all partitions in an update) of the AWS Cost & Usage Report (CUR). The line item ID isn't consistent between different Cost and Usage Reports and can't be used to identify the same line item across different reports.
{% enddocs %}

`BlendedCost` is blank for line items that have a `LineItemType` of `Discount`. Discounts are calculated using only the unblended cost of a member account, aggregated by member account and SKU. As a result, `BlendedCost` is not available for discounts.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs line_item_blended_rate %}
The BlendedRate is the average cost incurred for each SKU across an organization.

For example, the Amazon S3 blended rates are the total cost of storage divided by the amount of data stored per month. For accounts with RIs, the blended rates are calculated as the average costs of the RIs and the On-Demand Instances.

Blended rates are calculated at the management account level, and used to allocate costs to each member account. For more information, see Blended Rates and Costs in the AWS Billing User [Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/con-bill-blended-rates.html#Blended_CB).

- Amazon Web Services India Private Limited: The local Indian entity that acts as a reseller for AWS services in India.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs line_item_line_item_description %}
The description of the line item type. For example, the description of a usage line item summarizes the type of usage incurred during a specific time period.

For size-flexible RIs, the description corresponds to the RI the benefit was applied to. For example, if a line item corresponds to a `t2.micro` and a `t2.small` RI was applied to the usage, the `line_item_line_item_description` displays `t2.small`.

The description for a usage line item with an RI discount contains the pricing plan covered by the line item.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs line_item_line_item_type %}
The type of charge covered by this line item. The possible types are as follows:

- `BundledDiscount`: A usage-based discount that provides free or discounted usage of a service or feature based on the usage of another service or feature.
- `Credit`: Any credits that AWS applied to your bill. See the Description column for details. AWS might update reports after they've been finalized, if AWS applies a credit to your account for the month after finalizing your bill.
- `Discount`: Any discounts that AWS applied to your usage. This specific line item name may vary and require parsing based on the discount. For more information, refer to the `line_item_line_item_description` column.
- `DiscountedUsage`: The rate of any instances for which you had Reserved Instance (RI) benefits. Line items with an RI discount have a `line_item_line_item_type` of `DiscountedUsage`.

- `Refund`: The negative charges that AWS refunded money for. Review the Description column for details. AWS might update reports after they've been finalized, if AWS applies a refund to your account for the month after finalizing your bill.
- `RIFee`: The monthly recurring fee for subscriptions. For example, the recurring fee for Partial Upfront RIs, No Upfront RIs, and All Upfronts that you pay every month. Although the RIFee might be $0 for all upfront reservations, this line is still populated for those reservation types to provide other columns such as reservation/AmortizedUpfrontFeeForBillingPeriod and reservation/ReservationARN.
- `Tax`: Any taxes that AWS applied to your bill. For example, VAT or US sales tax. The exact type of tax will be reflected in the `line_item_tax_type` field.
- `Usage`: Any usage that is charged at On-Demand Instance rates.
- `SavingsPlanUpfrontFee`: Any one-time upfront fee from your purchase of an All Upfront or Partial Upfront Savings Plan.
- `SavingsPlanRecurringFee`: Any recurring hourly charges that correspond with your No Upfront or Partial Upfront Savings Plan. The Savings Plan recurring fee is initially added to your bill on the day that you purchase a No Upfront or Partial Upfront Savings Plan. After the initial purchase, AWS adds the recurring fee to the first day of each billing period thereafter.
- `SavingsPlanCoveredUsage`: Any On-Demand cost that is covered by your Savings Plan. Savings Plan covered usage line items are offset by the corresponding Savings Plan negation items.
- `SavingsPlanNegation` â€“ Any offset cost through your Savings Plan benefit thatâ€™s associated with the corresponding Savings Plan covered usage item.
