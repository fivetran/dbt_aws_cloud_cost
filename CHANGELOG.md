# dbt_aws_cloud_cost v0.1.0
This is the initial release of the `aws_cloud_cost` dbt package!

## ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?

This package models AWS Cloud Cost data from [Fivetran's AWS Cost Report connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/aws-cost-report). It uses data in the format described by the [AWS Cost & Usage Report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/table-dictionary-cur2.html).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core object tables into analytics-ready models, including:
  - Materializes [AWS Cloud Cost staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_aws_cloud_cost/#!/model/model.aws_cloud_cost.stg_aws_cloud_cost__report) which leverage data in the format described by the [AWS Cost & Usage Report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/table-dictionary-cur2.html). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your AWS Cloud Cost data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/aws-cost-report) for analysis by doing the following:
    - Names columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis:
        - Column names are shortened for convenience and to avoid redundancy.
    - Takes the latest export of each account's billing month report.
  - Creates analytics-ready end models for monitoring and investigating cost & usage of different AWS services across your organizations.
  - Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of both your AWS Cloud Cost source and modeled data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_aws_cloud_cost/).

> This package does not apply freshness tests.

The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default.
> TIP: See more details about these models in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_aws_cloud_cost/#!/overview/aws_cloud_cost).
